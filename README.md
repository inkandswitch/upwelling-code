# Upwell

This repository consists of multiple directories:

- `app`: The example application for non-fiction professional text editing
- `api`: The backend api that wraps the underlying logic for the upwell collaboration engine
- `docs`: Documentation for developer api
- `server`: Reference implementation for compatible remote server


## Get started

1. Follow `README.md` in `api`
2. `cd app`
3. `npm install`

## Rebuilding `api`

Every time the api changes, it needs to be rebuilt using `npm run build`
